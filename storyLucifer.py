Stories.
What are they ?
A chronological sequence of events, sychronous or asynchronous, congrous or incongrous, fundamental or derived.
A binding force, a powerful glue, holding the mankind together.
A tiger owes its power to its muscles and jaws.
A deer may owe its survival to its agility.
Human beings owe their strength and survival, both to their stories.
Maybe, stories are much more than a narration of a sequence of events.
